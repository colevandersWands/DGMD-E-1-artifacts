# TCER Model Foundations

**Understanding the Translational Computing Education Research framework**

---

## Overview

This section provides a complete explanation of the **Translational Computing Education Research (TCER)** model proposed by Cole, Malaise, and Signer (2023). Understanding this model is essential for recognizing how Embody operates as translational research.

## What is TCER?

**Translational Computing Education Research** is a unified framework for understanding, discussing, and conducting Computing Education Research (CER). It addresses two critical divides:

1. **Research/Practice Divide**: CER findings don't translate into educational practice
2. **Theory/Design Divide**: Learning theories don't translate into improved learning designs

The TCER model proposes that CER is fundamentally **translational**—moving knowledge bidirectionally between theory and practice, research and design.

### Key Insight

> "Theory and design are equally important but weighted differently depending on an activity's position along the research/practice continuum."

## The 7 Layers of TCER

The TCER model is organized in layers, from foundational to specific:

### **Layer 1: Engagement & Outreach** (Top - Spans All)
Continuous activity identifying challenges in Computing Education and opportunities for CER across all stakeholder groups.

### **Layer 2: Three Realms** (Equal, No Hierarchy)
1. **Fundamental Research**: Developing & validating theories
2. **Synthesis**: Disseminating knowledge
3. **Praxis**: Applying theory in practice

###  **Layer 3: Bodies of Knowledge** (5 Knowledge Domains)
1. **Theoretical CER**: Theories of how people learn/teach computing
2. **Experimental CER**: Empirical evidence base
3. **State of the Art**: Syntheses for different audiences
4. **Applied CER**: Prototypes and heuristics for contexts
5. **Educational Impact**: Insights from scaled interventions

### **Layer 4: Translational Phases** (5 Phases, Bidirectional)
1. **Theory Development**: Generating theories (general & domain-specific)
2. **Controlled Experiments**: Testing theories empirically
3. **Research Synthesis**: Communicating to researchers & practitioners
4. **Practice Research**: Designing & validating prototypes
5. **Scaled Interventions**: Deploying and analyzing impact

### **Layer 5: Activities** (10 Specific Activities, 2 per Phase)
Each phase has two activities marked A and B. Some are **Trading Zones*** (marked with asterisk) where transdisciplinary collaboration happens.

### **Layer 6: Research/Practice & Theory/Design Continuum**
Contributions positioned along two axes:
- **Research** (methodology-evaluated) ↔ **Practice** (effectiveness-evaluated)
- **Theory** (contributions to understanding) ↔ **Design** (contributions to practice)

Creates four quadrants: **RT** (Research Theories), **RD** (Research Designs), **PT** (Practice Theories), **PD** (Practice Designs)

### **Layer 7: Reflexive Analysis & Action** (Foundation)
CER must continuously reflect on and redefine itself to stay relevant.

## Why This Matters for Embody

Understanding TCER is crucial for recognizing that Embody is:
- **Not just a tool** (Phase 3A dissemination)
- **Research contribution** spanning multiple phases
- **Trading zone activity** coordinating diverse stakeholders
- **Exemplar of translational spectrum** with bidirectional theory-tool influence

## Quick Reference

### TCER Model Acronyms
- **RT**: Research Theories (methodologically validated)
- **RD**: Research Designs (strict methodology, for literature)
- **PT**: Practice Theories (useful heuristics for practitioners)
- **PD**: Practice Designs (for impact, any methodology)
- **TRP**: Translational Research Programme
- **IIC**: Inclusion-Immediacy Criterion

### The 10 Activities
1. **1.A*** - General or Borrowed Theories (trading zone)
2. **1.B** - Domain-Specific Theories
3. **2.A** - Theory-based Designs
4. **2.B** - Controlled, Empirical Experiments
5. **3.A** - Researcher-facing Literature Reviews
6. **3.B*** - Practitioner-facing Guidelines (trading zone)
7. **4.A*** - Evidence-based Prototypes (trading zone)
8. **4.B*** - User Feedback & Reports (trading zone)
9. **5.A*** - Scalable Contextualised Interventions (trading zone)
10. **5.B*** - Educational Impact Analysis (trading zone)
