# The Complete TCER Model

**A comprehensive description of all model components**

---

## Model Overview

The Translational Computing Education Research (TCER) model provides a unified framework for understanding Computing Education Research as a field. It recognizes CER as a **translational transdiscipline** where:
- **Translational**: Knowledge flows bidirectionally between research and practice
- **Transdiscipline**: Involves researchers, practitioners, learners, and other stakeholders transcending disciplinary boundaries

### Model Purpose

From the paper (Cole et al., 2023, p.3):

> "We do not propose the TCER model as dogma. All research and intervention efforts should operate within constraints in a way that best benefits their stakeholders and objectives... We developed our model simply to start the conversation about a shared framework for discussing and understanding CER."

---

## The 7 Layers (Complete Description)

The TCER model is organized in **7 layers** from most general (top) to most foundational (bottom). Each layer provides progressively finer-grained structure.

---

### **Layer 1: Engagement and Outreach**

**Position**: Top layer, spans horizontally across all phases

**Purpose**: Continuous activity to identify challenges in Computing Education and opportunities for CER

**From the paper** (p.4, Section 3.2.2):

> "Computing education is everywhere. It is online tutorials, it is meetup groups, it is children, adults and everything in between... If CER is to stay relevant it will need to make a concerted effort to identify new challenges in CE, reach CE communities where they are, and work productively with a variety of stakeholders."

**Key Activities**:
- Identifying challenges in Computing Education
- Identifying opportunities for CER
- Reaching CE communities
- Working with diverse stakeholders

**Why This Matters**: Without continuous engagement, CER becomes isolated from the real-world problems it aims to solve.

---

### **Layer 2: The Three Realms**

**Position**: Below Engagement, spanning all phases

**Purpose**: Organize CER into three equal realms without hierarchy

#### **Fundamental Research**
**Description**: Developing and validating theories for Computing Education

**Activities**: Theory development, empirical validation, building theoretical foundations

**Example Work**: Developing notional machine theory, validating threshold concepts in programming

#### **Synthesis**
**Description**: Consolidating and communicating knowledge from Fundamental Research and Praxis

**Activities**: Literature reviews (researcher-facing), practical guidelines (practitioner-facing)

**Example Work**: Systematic reviews, meta-analyses, evidence-based teaching guides

#### **Praxis**
**Description**: Designing evidence-based solutions for Computing Education in practice

**Activities**: Prototype development, intervention deployment, impact analysis

**Example Work**: Educational tools, curricula, scalable programmes

**Important Note**: These realms are **equal in value**. None is more important than others—they serve different purposes in the translational spectrum.

---

### **Layer 3: Bodies of Knowledge**

**Position**: Below Realms, feeding into specific phases

**Purpose**: Distinct but interrelated groupings of knowledge in CE

#### **1. Theoretical CER**
**Description**: Theoretical understanding of how people teach and learn computing

**Realm**: Fundamental Research

**Grows From**: Theory Development (Phase 1)

**Examples**: Mental model theories, cognitive load theory in programming, notional machines

#### **2. Experimental CER**
**Description**: Bodies of empirical evidence used to develop CE theories and inform practice

**Realm**: Fundamental Research

**Grows From**: Controlled Experiments (Phase 2)

**Examples**: RCT data, qualitative study findings, mixed-methods evidence

#### **3. State of the Art**
**Description**: Syntheses of all bodies of knowledge, communicated differently for different audiences

**Realm**: Synthesis

**Grows From**: Research Synthesis (Phase 3)

**Examples**: Literature reviews, systematic reviews, evidence summaries, teaching guides

#### **4. Applied CER**
**Description**: Prototypes and heuristics inspired by state of the art for specific educational outcomes in specific contexts

**Realm**: Praxis

**Grows From**: Practice Research (Phase 4)

**Examples**: Evidence-based tools, pilot interventions, validated designs

#### **5. Educational Impact**
**Description**: Practical insights gained from scaling educational interventions and analyzing their impact

**Realm**: Praxis

**Grows From**: Scaled Interventions (Phase 5)

**Examples**: Deployment reports, impact analyses, lessons learned from scale

**Key Insight**: Bodies of knowledge are not isolated—bidirectional arrows between phases show constant knowledge exchange.

---

### **Layer 4: Translational Phases**

**Position**: Below Bodies of Knowledge

**Purpose**: Structure the theory/design and research/practice continuum into actionable phases

**Critical Clarification** (p.3):

> "While the TCER model might seem to be linear with siloed progression from theory to intervention, we foresee strong feedback loops between all research activities. This dynamic has also been called the 'translational science spectrum'."

#### **Phase 1: Theory Development**

**Realm**: Fundamental Research
**Body of Knowledge**: Theoretical CER
**Purpose**: Generating and developing theories of how people learn and teach programming

**Two Activities**:
- **1.A*** (Trading Zone): General or Borrowed Theories
  - Explore and borrow learning theories from other domains
  - Examples: Cognitive Load Theory, Constructivism, Threshold Concepts

- **1.B**: Domain-Specific Theories
  - Develop domain-specific learning theories for computing education
  - Examples: Notional machines, program comprehension models, debugging theories

#### **Phase 2: Controlled Experiments**

**Realm**: Fundamental Research
**Body of Knowledge**: Experimental CER
**Purpose**: Testing and exploring theories with controlled experiments

**Two Activities**:
- **2.A**: Theory-based Designs
  - Designing small-scale focused interventions to test or develop specific theories
  - Create controlled conditions for empirical validation

- **2.B**: Controlled, Empirical Experiments
  - Use controlled experiments to investigate theories from 1.A/B and designs from 2.A
  - Generate empirical evidence
  - Note: Separating 2.A and 2.B helps establish replication standards

#### **Phase 3: Research Synthesis**

**Realm**: Synthesis
**Body of Knowledge**: State of the Art
**Purpose**: Synthesizing results from all phases and communicating to stakeholders

**Two Activities**:
- **3.A**: Researcher-facing Literature Reviews
  - Perform systematic literature reviews of activities in all phases
  - Target academic audiences
  - Examples: Systematic reviews, meta-analyses, theory syntheses

- **3.B*** (Trading Zone): Practitioner-facing Guidelines
  - Produce evidence-based practical guidelines for CE practitioners
  - Target educators, tool developers, curriculum designers
  - Examples: Teaching guides, best practices, implementation frameworks

**From the paper** (p.5):

> "To aid in communication, our model has defined a phase of research (phase 3) dedicated to synthesising and disseminating the state of the art to both academic and non-academic audiences."

#### **Phase 4: Practice Research**

**Realm**: Praxis
**Body of Knowledge**: Applied CER
**Purpose**: Designing and validating prototypes that apply CE theory in diverse educational contexts

**Two Activities**:
- **4.A*** (Trading Zone): Evidence-based Prototypes
  - Design evidence-based prototypes for targeted educational outcomes and contexts
  - Share ongoing designs and process
  - Examples: Educational tools, pilot curricula, intervention prototypes

- **4.B*** (Trading Zone): User Feedback & Reports
  - Understand what works and what doesn't in different settings
  - Share insights to progress theory and design
  - Examples: Field reports, usability studies, practitioner feedback

**Key Characteristic**: This is where research meets practice most directly. Prototypes are evidence-based but designed for real-world impact.

#### **Phase 5: Scaled Interventions**

**Realm**: Praxis
**Body of Knowledge**: Educational Impact
**Purpose**: Exploiting successful designs to have large-scale impact in computing education

**Two Activities**:
- **5.A*** (Trading Zone): Scalable Contextualised Interventions
  - Develop and deploy scalable interventions based on promising prototypes
  - Adapt to different contexts while maintaining evidence base

- **5.B*** (Trading Zone): Educational Impact Analysis
  - Conduct follow-up studies to analyze intervention impact
  - Publish reports sharing findings
  - Feed insights back to earlier phases

**From the paper** (p.5):

> "Translational research can only succeed if researchers and practitioners engage in active collaborations and when all stakeholders have reliable channels of communication and shared knowledge."

---

### **Layer 5: The 10 Activities**

**Position**: Below Translational Phases

**Purpose**: Define specific activities within each phase

Each phase has **two activities** (A and B). Activities marked with * are **Trading Zones** where transdisciplinary collaboration is essential.

#### **Trading Zones Concept**

From the paper (p.5, Section 3.2.7, quoting Galison 1996):

> "Trading zones [are] 'an arena in which radically different activities could be locally, but not globally, coordinated.'"

**What this means**:
- **Locally coordinated**: Different stakeholders work together on specific activities
- **Not globally coordinated**: They don't need to share the same overarching philosophy/methodology

**Trading Zones in TCER**:
- 1.A* - Borrowing theories from other fields
- 3.B* - Bridging to practitioners
- 4.A*, 4.B* - Coordinating research and practice
- 5.A*, 5.B* - Coordinating deployment and impact

**Why This Matters**: Trading zones are where most innovation happens, where different perspectives create new insights.

#### **Activity Details**

See [Layers Explained](./layers-explained.md) for comprehensive description of each activity.

---

### **Layer 6: The Continuum**

**Position**: Below Activities

**Purpose**: Show how contributions vary along two axes

#### **Two Axes** (Figure 2, p.4)

**Research ↔ Practice Axis**:
- **Research**: Artefacts evaluated by their methodology
- **Practice**: Artefacts evaluated by their effectiveness

**Theory ↔ Design Axis**:
- **Theory**: Contribution to CE understanding
- **Design**: Contribution to CE practice

#### **Four Quadrants**

Creates four categories of contribution (but remember: it's a continuum, not discrete boxes):

**RT (Research Theories)**:
- Methodologically and empirically validated theories of CE
- Examples: Validated notional machine models, empirically-tested threshold concepts

**RD (Research Designs)**:
- Designs created with strict methodology, intended for CER literature or to validate theories
- Examples: Experimental curricula for theory testing, controlled intervention designs

**PT (Practice Theories)**:
- Useful theories for practitioners that may not be methodologically rigorous
- Could be called "heuristics" or rules of thumb
- Examples: "Students struggle with pointers" (observed but not empirically validated)

**PD (Practice Designs)**:
- Designs whose main purpose is to impact CE practice
- Can be developed with any methodology
- May or may not be evidence-based
- Examples: Actual deployed curricula, commercial educational tools

**From the paper** (p.4, Section 3.2.1):

> "Overall, no contribution is more important than another and it is a question of context, with different contributions being more valuable to different activities."

#### **Continuum Representation**

At the bottom of Figure 1, the continuum shows how contributions shift from pure Research Theory (left) through mixed RT/RD, then PT/PD, to pure Practice Design (right).

**Key Insight**: A single project can span multiple positions on the continuum simultaneously.

---

### **Layer 7: Reflexive Analysis & Action**

**Position**: Foundation layer (bottom)

**Purpose**: Ensure CER continuously evolves and stays relevant

**From the paper** (p.5, Section 3.3):

> "This final feature of our model is the most important one because even if our model were perfect today, it might become obsolete in the future. A field without the culture and mechanisms to support self-reflection and re-definition cannot stay relevant."

**Key Activities**:
- Self-reflection on CER as a field
- Re-definition as needed
- Hard-coding reflexive culture into field practices
- Training new members to question and refine

**Why This is the Foundation**: Without reflexive analysis, the model becomes rigid dogma rather than a living framework.

**Current Evidence of Reflexive Culture in CER**:
- Recent publications about CER methodology
- Special issues on theory in CER
- Conference proceedings and discussions
- Social media and blog conversations

**Future Requirement**: Each generation of CE researchers should feel empowered to help (re)define the field.

## How the Layers Work Together

The layers are not independent—they form an integrated system:

```
 Engagement & Outreach
        ↓ (identifies challenges/opportunities)
    Three Realms
        ↓ (structures work into)
  Bodies of Knowledge
        ↓ (accumulated through)
 Translational Phases
        ↓ (enacted via)
    10 Activities
        ↓ (positioned on)
  Research/Practice & Theory/Design Continuum
        ↓ (all supported by)
 Reflexive Analysis & Action
```

### The Bidirectional Arrows

**Critical Feature**: Between Bodies of Knowledge and Translational Phases, and between phases themselves, are **bidirectional arrows** (⟷).

**What They Mean**:
- Knowledge doesn't just flow left-to-right (theory → practice)
- Practice informs theory just as theory informs practice
- This is the "translational spectrum" not a "pipeline"

**Example Flow**:
```
Phase 1 Theory → Phase 2 Experiments → Phase 3 Synthesis → Phase 4 Prototypes
                            ↑                               ↓
                    Phase 4 Feedback ← Phase 5 Impact ← Phase 4 Deployment
```

## Judging the Model

The authors propose judging TCER as a "threshold concept" (p.3, Section 3.1):

### Criteria (based on Flanagan's threshold concepts):

- **Transformative**: Does TCER change how you view CER?
- **Irreversible**: Once you see CER as translational, is it hard to go back?
- **Integrative**: Does TCER bring together different aspects of CER that seemed unrelated?
- **Bounded**: Does TCER delineate CER, making it easier to understand as unified?
- **Discursive**: Does understanding TCER give you richer vocabulary for discussing CE?
- **Reconstitutive**: Does understanding TCER change your interactions with CE?
- **Liminal**: Can you imagine learning TCER being a "rite of passage" for newcomers?

**Self-Assessment Question**: Do these criteria apply to your understanding after reading this model?

## Key Distinctions

### CER vs. Other Research Models

**Pasteur's Quadrant** (referenced p.4):
- Uses different axes (fundamental understanding vs. considerations of use)
- Binary values on both axes
- TCER: Sliding scale, draws value from all quadrants, different axes

**Medical Translational Research**:
- Phases T0-T4 in medicine
- TCER adapted for CE realities (no regulatory barriers, faster iteration, lower risk)
- Similar bidirectional concept

### CER vs. Discipline-Based Education Research (DBER)

**DBER definition** (p.2):
- Narrowly focused on research aspects
- TCER: Includes practice, non-academic stakeholders, systemic solutions

### Why "Translational Transdiscipline"?

**Transdisciplinary** (p.2, quoting Choi & Pak 2006):

> "Transdisciplinary involves scientists from different disciplines as well as non-scientists and other stakeholders and, through role release and role expansion, transcends (hence 'trans') the disciplinary boundaries to look at the dynamics of whole systems in a holistic way."

**Both terms matter**:
- **Translational**: Bidirectional knowledge flow
- **Transdisciplinary**: Crosses boundaries, includes non-academics, systemic view

---

## Limitations and Caveats

### What the Authors Say (p.3):

> "We recognise that CER is diverse and some activities may not fit cleanly in our model."

### Known Challenges from Medicine

The paper discusses criticisms of Translational Research in medicine (p.1-2):

1. **Translational Imperative**: Pressure to justify all work with broader impacts, discouraging exploratory research
   - **TCER Response**: Fundamental research (Phase 1) is valued equally

2. **Pipeline Misconception**: Appears linear, creating false expectations
   - **TCER Response**: Explicit bidirectional arrows, "translational spectrum" language

3. **Historical Inefficiency**: Medical TR has been "wildly inefficient" over 30 years
   - **TCER Response**: CER has advantages (Section 2.3 lists 11 defining features making translation more feasible)

### Why CER Can Succeed Where Medicine Struggles

From Section 2.3 (p.3), CER has unique advantages:
- No legal/regulatory barriers (only ethical)
- Lives not at risk (small experiments are safe)
- Wide variety of stakeholders who can all benefit
- Curricula can be updated incrementally
- Relatively small field (broad+deep understanding possible)
- Researchers often are educators (first-hand insights)
- Educators have technical skills (can implement prototypes)
- Prototyping is cheap and fast
- Tight feedback loops possible (research with real learners)
- Culture of teaching, learning, making in computing
- Strong public interest in improving CE
