# Reflexive Analysis

**What we learned about TCER and Embody through this framing exercise**

---

## Purpose

From Cole et al. (2023, p.5, Section 3.3):

> "This final feature of our model is the most important one because even if our model were perfect today, it might become obsolete in the future. A field without the culture and mechanisms to support self-reflection and re-definition cannot stay relevant."

This section embodies that reflexive culture: **what did we learn** by mapping Embody to TCER, and **what does this reveal** about both?

---

## What We Learned About Embody

### 1. Multi-Phase Presence Is Normal

**Initial worry**: "Embody seems to be in too many phases—maybe I misunderstand the model?"

**Realization**: Multi-phase presence is exactly what translational work looks like.

- Phase 1.B (theories) + Phase 4.A (infrastructure) simultaneously
- Not sequential ("first theory, then tool") but co-evolutionary
- Trading zones (3.B*, 4.A*) require spanning multiple positions
- This is a **strength**, not confusion

**Evidence from paper** (p.3):
> "While the TCER model might seem to be linear with siloed progression from theory to intervention, we foresee strong feedback loops between all research activities."

Embody demonstrates those feedback loops in practice.

### 2. Infrastructure Is Research Contribution

**Initial framing**: "I'm building a tool that applies notional machine research"

**Corrected framing**: "I'm conducting Phase 1.B theory development and Phase 4.A* infrastructure research simultaneously"

**Why this matters**:
- Building Embody **created new knowledge** (12 domain-specific notional machines)
- Infrastructure **enables research** that wasn't feasible before (future Phase 2 experiments)
- Both are research contributions, not one "real" and one "enabling"

**Analogy**: Like CERN—building the accelerator IS physics research, not "preparation for" physics research.

### 3. Methodology Is Contribution

**Initial assumption**: Theory-to-requirements is documentation for the tool work

**Realization**: Theory-to-requirements is itself a methodological contribution

- Replicable pattern for translational infrastructure research
- Addresses methodological gap in CER
- Demonstrates how to systematically integrate theory development (1.B) with prototyping (4.A*)

**This can be published separately** from the tool itself.

**Translational Sprint recognition**: Discovering TS vocabulary made explicit what we were doing implicitly—constraint-driven, cyclical, packaged for replication (Stage 5).

### 4. Neutral Infrastructure Enables Trading Zones

**Design decision**: Keep Embody theory-neutral (don't encode specific pedagogy)

**TCER insight**: This neutrality is **what makes Phase 4.A* trading zones work**

- Diverse stakeholders coordinate locally (on interface, accuracy)
- Don't need global alignment (on pedagogy, theory, goals)
- Same infrastructure serves constructivists and direct instruction advocates
- This is the **power** of trading zones—coordination without consensus

**Implication**: If we'd embedded one pedagogy, we'd have excluded other stakeholders.

### 5. Theory-to-Requirements Maps to TCER Naturally

**Discovery**: Our 5-phase process wasn't arbitrary—it follows translational spectrum

| Our Phase | TCER Phase | Insight |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| 0 (Lit review) | 3.A | Research synthesis before theory development |
| 1 (Taxonomies) | 3.B* | Practitioner translation creates trading zones |
| 3 (Threshold) | 1.A* | Borrowed theories adapted to domain |
| 4 (Notional machines) | 1.B | Domain-specific theory creation |
| 5 (Requirements) | 4.A* | Infrastructure operationalizes theories |

**We intuitively followed translational pattern** before knowing TCER model explicitly.

## What We Learned About TCER

### 1. Infrastructure Fits Without New Layer

**Question we asked**: "Does measurement infrastructure need its own dimension in TCER?"

**Answer**: No—Phase 4.A* trading zones accommodate infrastructure perfectly.

**Why this matters**:
- TCER model is **robust** enough to handle infrastructure research
- Trading zone concept is **powerful** enough to coordinate measurement work
- No need to modify model—just deeper understanding of Phase 4.A*

**This validates the model's design**—it already thought of this use case.

### 2. Tool-Theory Co-evolution Is Accommodated

**Pattern**: Can't build tool without theories, can't test theories without tool

**TCER handling**: Simultaneous Phase 1.B + 4.A* work with bidirectional arrows

**Evidence**: The model explicitly shows **feedback loops** between phases (p.3)

**Implication**: TCER was designed for exactly this kind of co-evolutionary work.

### 3. Trading Zones Are Underemphasized?

**Observation**: 6 of 10 activities are trading zones (*), but the concept gets limited discussion in paper

**Why trading zones matter more than we initially realized**:
- They're where **innovation happens** (diverse perspectives meet)
- They're where **translation occurs** (research ↔ practice)
- They're where **coordination without consensus** becomes possible

**Potential for CER**: More explicit guidance on **how to operate in trading zones**

- How to maintain local coordination?
- What makes good boundary objects?
- When does trading zone break down (forced global alignment)?

### 4. Continuum Span Is Key to Impact

**Insight**: Embody's value comes from spanning RT → RD → PT

- **RT position** (notional machines): Researchers can validate theories
- **RD position** (config schemas): Researchers can design experiments
- **PT position** (practitioner guides): Tool developers can build applications

**If we'd only occupied one position**, we'd have limited audience and impact.

**Generalization**: Phase 4.A* projects should **intentionally span continuum** to maximize stakeholder value.

### 5. Phase Numbers Don't Imply Sequence

**Easy mistake**: "Phase 1 comes before Phase 2"

**Reality**: Phases describe **types of activity**, not temporal order

**Evidence from Embody**:
- We did Phase 3.A (lit review) **before** Phase 1.B (notional machines)
- We did Phase 4.A (prototyping) **during** Phase 1.B (theory development)
- Phases 1, 3, 4 were **simultaneous**, not sequential

**Paper addresses this** (p.3: "feedback loops"), but easy to misinterpret from Figure 1 alone.

## Gaps and Questions

### 1. How Common Is Multi-Phase Work?

**Question**: Is Embody unusual in spanning Phases 1, 3, 4 simultaneously?

**Hypothesis**: Other infrastructure projects likely also multi-phase, but may not recognize it

**Implication**: CER field could benefit from more examples of multi-phase classification

**Future work**: Survey existing tools/infrastructure through TCER lens

### 2. Methodology Guidance for Phase 4.A*

**Question**: How should one **systematically** conduct Phase 4.A* research?

**What TCER provides**: Definition of phase, examples, trading zone concept

**What's missing**: Step-by-step methodology (like DBR has for interventions)

**Embody contribution**: Theory-to-requirements provides one methodology, but is it generalizable?

**Future work**: Develop Phase 4.A* methodology guidelines for CER

### 3. When Should Infrastructure Be Neutral vs. Pedagogical?

**Embody decision**: Stay theory-neutral to serve diverse users

**Question**: Is this always the right choice for Phase 4.A* infrastructure?

**Tradeoffs**:
- **Neutral**: Broader audience, trading zone function, but less opinionated
- **Pedagogical**: Clearer guidance, stronger claims, but narrower audience

**Hypothesis**: Depends on goal
- Research instruments → neutral (enable diverse theories)
- Educational interventions → pedagogical (test specific approach)

**Future work**: When should Phase 4.A move toward Phase 5.A deployment (which requires pedagogical stance)?

### 4. How to Measure Infrastructure Research Impact?

**Challenge**: Traditional metrics don't capture infrastructure value

**Publication metrics**:
- Paper citations ✓ (measures academic impact)
- GitHub stars ✗ (measures popularity, not research impact)

**Research enablement**:
- Studies using the infrastructure ✓ (but only after Phase 2/5 work)
- Theories validated via infrastructure ✓ (but long-term outcome)

**Question**: How to evaluate Phase 4.A* contributions **before** they enable Phase 2/5?

**Possible metrics**:
- Systematic theory-to-requirements process (methodological rigor)
- Stakeholder diversity (trading zone success)
- Theoretical contributions embedded (Phase 1.B outputs)

### 5. Relationship to Design-Based Research (DBR)?

**DBR** is established methodology in education research

**Question**: How does TCER Phase 4.A* relate to DBR?

**Similarities**:
- Iterative design
- Theory-practice integration
- Design as research contribution

**Differences**:
- DBR focuses on interventions (curricula, pedagogies)
- TCER 4.A* includes infrastructure (measurement, tools)
- DBR less explicit about trading zones

**Hypothesis**: DBR could be viewed as specific methodology **within** TCER Phases 4-5

**Future work**: Map DBR to TCER explicitly (benefits both frameworks)

## Implications for CER Field

### 1. Recognize Infrastructure as Research

**Current risk**: Tools seen as "service work" not "research contribution"

**TCER clarity**: Phase 4.A* infrastructure is research when:
- Evidence-based (grounded in theory)
- Creates new knowledge (theory development, methodology)
- Enables future research (Phase 2 experiments)

**Action for CER**: Value infrastructure contributions in tenure/promotion, publication venues

### 2. Document Methodologies

**Current gap**: Few systematic methodologies for infrastructure research

**Opportunity**: Each successful Phase 4.A* project should document process

**Embody example**: Theory-to-requirements as replicable methodology

**Action for CER**: Encourage methodology documentation, perhaps dedicated venue

### 3. Embrace Multi-Phase Contributions

**Current tendency**: Categorize work as "theory" OR "tool" OR "synthesis"

**TCER insight**: Work can be **all three simultaneously** (like Embody)

**Action for CER**:
- Papers can claim multiple contribution types
- Theses can frame multi-phase work coherently
- Reviewers should recognize translational patterns

### 4. Leverage Trading Zones

**Current challenge**: Research-practice divide persists

**TCER solution**: Trading zones enable coordination without consensus

**Embody demonstration**: Neutral infrastructure serves diverse stakeholders

**Action for CER**:
- Design projects to function as trading zones
- Create boundary objects (shared artifacts)
- Don't force global alignment (allow local coordination)

### 5. Make Translation Explicit

**Current invisibility**: Translation work often uncredited

**TCER visibility**: Phases 3.B* and 4.A* are explicit translation activities

**Action for CER**:
- Recognize translation as research contribution
- Credit researchers who bridge theory-practice
- Value practitioner-facing outputs (not just academic papers)

## Personal Reflections (Meta-Learning)

### What Changed for Me

**Before TCER framing**:
- Felt like Embody was "messy" (theory + tool + synthesis all mixed)
- Worried about justifying tool building as research
- Unclear how to position contributions

**After TCER framing**:
- Multi-phase presence is **exactly what translational work looks like**
- Infrastructure building **is research** when done systematically
- Have clear vocabulary for each contribution type

**Confidence shift**: From defensive ("it's not just a tool!") to assertive ("here are three research contributions")

### What Surprised Me

1. **Trading zones concept is powerful**: Didn't realize how much Embody's design embodies this pattern
2. **Methodology as contribution**: Theory-to-requirements process is publishable work
3. **Co-evolution is fundamental**: Can't separate tool building from theory development in infrastructure work
4. **Model already accommodates**: Didn't need to modify TCER—just understand it deeply

### What This Enables

**For thesis**:
- Clear framing of contributions
- Explicit positioning in CER field
- Justification for multi-phase work

**For papers**:
- Methodology paper (theory-to-requirements process)
- Theoretical paper (12 JavaScript notional machines)
- Infrastructure paper (Embody as Phase 4.A* example)

**For future work**:
- Phase 2 experiments using Embody
- Phase 5 deployments with usage feedback
- Methodological guidance for others

## Recommendations

### For Others Doing Infrastructure Research

1. **Map your work to TCER explicitly**: Clarifies contributions, positions in field
2. **Document your methodology**: Translation process is research contribution
3. **Embrace multi-phase presence**: It's a strength, not confusion
4. **Design for trading zones**: Neutral infrastructure serves broader audience
5. **Claim theoretical contributions**: If you created domain-specific theories, say so

### For TCER Model Development

1. **Amplify trading zones**: Concept deserves more emphasis and guidance
2. **Clarify temporal flexibility**: Phase numbers don't mean sequence
3. **Provide Phase 4.A* methodologies**: Like DBR for interventions, need process guidance for infrastructure
4. **Showcase infrastructure examples**: More case studies beyond interventions
5. **Address impact metrics**: How to evaluate infrastructure before it enables later phases?

### For CER Community

1. **Value infrastructure research**: Recognize it as multi-phase contribution
2. **Support methodology sharing**: Create venues for process documentation
3. **Encourage translation work**: Credit Phases 3.B* and 4.A* explicitly
4. **Normalize multi-phase contributions**: Not everything fits one category
5. **Foster trading zone culture**: Coordination without forced consensus

## Conclusion

This reflexive analysis reveals:

**About Embody**:
- Multi-phase translational research spanning 1.B, 3.A, 3.B*, 4.A*
- Three contribution types: theoretical, synthesizing, methodological
- Demonstrates tool-theory co-evolution in practice

**About TCER**:
- Robust enough to accommodate infrastructure research
- Trading zones are key mechanism for translation
- Model already designed for co-evolutionary work

**About CER Field**:
- Need to recognize infrastructure as research
- Need methodologies for Phase 4.A* work
- Need to value translation work explicitly

**The meta-insight**: By applying TCER reflexively to Embody, we demonstrated the model's reflexive analysis layer (Layer 7) in action—using the framework to understand our own work, which in turn revealed insights about the framework itself.

**This is exactly what reflexive transdisciplinarity looks like.**
