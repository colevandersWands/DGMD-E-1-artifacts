# Embody and Translational Sprints

**How Embody both IS and ENABLES agile translational research**

---

## The Dual Role

Embody has two relationships with Translational Sprints (Cole & Bean, 2023):

1. **Embody's development WAS a Translational Sprint**
2. **Embody ENABLES future Translational Sprints**

Both roles are research contributions. Both demonstrate how CER can be rapid, cyclical, and rigorous.

## Part 1: Embody as Translational Sprint

### Our Sprint Execution

| TS Stage | What We Did | Evidence | Status |
|----------|-------------|----------|--------|
| **0. Relationship & Trust** | Stakeholder research, practitioner needs | Implicit in design decisions | ✓ Complete |
| **1. Challenge Scope** | "Need neutral JS trace infrastructure" | `/theory-to-requirements/` scope | ✓ Complete |
| **2. Design Alternatives** | 12 notional machines, config schemas | `/4-notional-machines/`, `/1-taxonomies/` | ✓ Complete |
| **3. Experimental Validation** | Test trace-based learning theories | *Future Phase 2.B work* | ⏳ Next sprint |
| **4. Integration Design** | Deploy in educational tools, gather feedback | *Future Phase 4.B work* | ⏳ Next sprint |
| **5. Intervention Packaging** | Full methodology documentation | `/theory-to-requirements/`, `/embodying-tcer/` | ✓ Complete |

**Current position**: Mid-sprint (Stages 0-2 and 5 complete)

**Next iteration**: Will cycle back to Stage 2 after collecting Stage 3/4 data

### Why This Pattern Emerged

**We intuitively followed TS methodology** without formal model awareness:

**Constraint-driven** (Stage 1 scoping):
- JavaScript only (not all languages)
- Trace data only (not pedagogy or tools)
- Systematic process (theory-to-requirements)

**Cyclical refinement** (Stage 2 iterations):
- Notional machines evolved through multiple passes
- Config requirements refined with theoretical understanding
- Dead ends led to returns (not failures)

**Co-creation** (Stage 0 foundation):
- Trading zones with tool developers
- Practitioner-facing guidelines
- Neutral infrastructure serves diverse needs

**Packaged for replication** (Stage 5):
- Complete theory-to-requirements documentation
- Methodology explicitly described
- `/embodying-tcer` analysis for researchers

### The Sprint Vocabulary Explains Our Process

**"Multi-phase presence in TCER"** = Executing multiple TS stages simultaneously

**"Tool-theory co-evolution"** = Stage 2 cyclical design alternatives

**"Trading zones"** = Stage 0 relationship foundation maintained throughout

**"Theory-to-requirements process"** = Structured approach to Stage 2

**"Future Phase 2/4.B work"** = Explicit next sprint stages

## Part 2: Embody as Sprint Accelerator

### How Infrastructure Enables Future Sprints

**The bottleneck Embody eliminates**:

Traditional approach:
```
Stage 1: Scope challenge (weeks)
         ↓
Stage 2: Build measurement tool (months to years) ← BOTTLENECK
         ↓
Stage 2: Design intervention (weeks)
         ↓
Stage 3: Validate (months)
```

With Embody:
```
Stage 1: Scope challenge (weeks)
         ↓
Stage 2: Design intervention (weeks) ← Start here
         ↓
Stage 3: Validate (months)
```

**Time saved**: Months to years per sprint

### Example Future Sprints Embody Enables

**Sprint A**: "Effect of trace granularity on closure learning"
- **Stage 1**: Scope immediately (Embody exists)
- **Stage 2**: Design conditions using `config.traceClosureCapture` variations
- **Stage 3**: Run controlled study with consistent trace format
- **Stage 4**: Deploy best condition in tools
- **Stage 5**: Publish results + config recipes

**Without Embody**: Must build tracer first (6-12 months before Stage 2)
**With Embody**: Stage 2 starts Week 1

**Sprint B**: "Async comprehension scaffolding strategies"
- Uses `config.traceAsync` variations
- Different pedagogies, same measurement
- Comparable across studies

**Sprint C**: "Misconception detection via trace patterns"
- Uses complete execution traces
- Pattern classification experiments
- Validates detection heuristics

**Sprint D**: "Variable role identification for assessment"
- Uses variable lifecycle traces
- Automatic role classification
- Formative feedback generation

**Common thread**: All skip "build instrumentation" stage

### TRP Coordination via Shared Infrastructure

**Multi-institution sprint coordination**:

| Institution | Sprint Focus | Embody Configuration | Stage |
|-------------|--------------|---------------------|-------|
| **Uni A** | Bootcamp closure learning | Full scope traces | Stage 3 |
| **Uni B** | CS1 loop patterns | Control flow focus | Stage 2 |
| **Uni C** | High school async intro | Async detail = minimal | Stage 4 |
| **Uni D** | Self-taught debugging | Complete traces | Stage 3 |

**What shared infrastructure enables**:
- Each runs independent TS
- All use consistent trace format
- Stage 5 outputs are comparable
- Meta-analysis becomes feasible

**Example TRP**: "Trace-Based JavaScript Learning Across Contexts"
- Coordinated challenge: How do traces improve learning?
- Independent designs: Each institution's pedagogy
- Shared measurement: Embody configuration variations
- Cumulative knowledge: Cross-context patterns

**Without Embody**: Incompatible data, no meta-analysis possible
**With Embody**: Coordinated research programme feasible

## Connection to TCER Phases

### TS Stages Map to TCER Phases

| TS Stage | Primary TCER Phase | Secondary | Notes |
|----------|-------------------|-----------|-------|
| **0. Relationship/Trust** | (Foundation) | All phases | Enables trading zones |
| **1. Challenge Scope** | 3.A | 1.A* | Synthesis + borrowed theories |
| **2. Design Alternatives** | 2.A, 1.B | 4.A* | Design + domain theories + prototyping |
| **3. Experimental Validation** | 2.B | | Controlled experiments |
| **4. Integration Design** | 4.A*, 4.B* | | Prototypes + feedback |
| **5. Intervention Packaging** | 5.A, 3.B* | | Scaled interventions + guidelines |

**Key insight**: Each TS executes mini-TCER cycle

**The nested structure**:
- TCER provides **framework** (5 phases, bodies of knowledge)
- TS provides **operational methodology** (6 stages, cyclical process)
- Each sprint **traverses multiple TCER phases**
- Multiple sprints **build cumulative knowledge**

### Embody's Phase Span Through TS Lens

**Our sprint touched all TCER phases**:

- **Phase 1.A***: Borrowed threshold concepts, NM theory (Stage 1)
- **Phase 1.B**: Developed 12 JS-specific notional machines (Stage 2)
- **Phase 2.A**: Designed trace-based research instruments (Stage 2)
- **Phase 3.A**: Systematic literature synthesis (Stage 1)
- **Phase 3.B***: Practitioner guidelines (Stage 5)
- **Phase 4.A***: Evidence-based prototype (Stage 2)
- **Future 2.B**: Experimental validation (Stage 3)
- **Future 4.B**: Deployment feedback (Stage 4)
- **Future 5.A**: Scaled interventions (Stage 4)

**This is normal for TS** - sprints don't stay in one phase

## Agile Principles in Practice

### Adapted from Agile Manifesto

**Relationships and wellbeing over research deliverables**

How Embody embodies this:
- Trading zones prioritize stakeholder coordination
- Neutral design respects diverse pedagogical approaches
- Documentation enables collaboration, doesn't constrain
- Long-term partnerships > one-off publications

**Working infrastructure over comprehensive theory**

How Embody embodies this:
- Prototype demonstrates feasibility early
- Theory develops alongside building (co-evolution)
- Don't wait for "complete" theory before shipping
- Iteration improves both tool and theory

**Stakeholder collaboration over academic gatekeeping**

How Embody embodies this:
- Practitioner-facing guidelines (Phase 3.B*)
- Open methodology documentation
- Tool developers as equal partners
- Replicable process, not black box

**Responding to constraints over following ideal plan**

How Embody embodies this:
- JavaScript-only scope (manageable)
- Trace-only focus (clear boundary)
- Cyclical returns when hitting dead ends
- Adapt process to findings, not force fit

### Process Markers, Not Milestones

**From TS methodology**:
> Process markers over milestones - flexible checkpoints that adapt

**Why "markers" not "milestones"**:
- Milestones are rigid (must achieve before proceeding)
- Markers are flexible (guides, not gates)
- Can adjust as circumstances evolve
- Embodies agile responsiveness

**Embody's process markers**:
- Each theory-to-requirements subdirectory = marker
- Can skip, reorder, or return as needed
- Documentation tracks progress, doesn't prescribe it
- Stage 5 packaging happens continuously, not at end

## Comparison: Traditional vs. Translational Sprint

| Aspect | Traditional Research | Translational Sprint |
|--------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Timeline** | Years per publication | Weeks to months per sprint |
| **Scope** | Comprehensive coverage | Constrained challenge |
| **Progress** | Linear (theory → tool → test) | Cyclical (return on dead ends) |
| **Ownership** | Researcher-driven | Co-created with practitioners |
| **Failure** | Hidden or unpublished | Valued, documented, published |
| **Speed vs. Rigor** | Rigor requires time | Rigor within constraints |
| **Infrastructure** | Built per-project | Shared across sprints |
| **Iteration** | Avoided (seems like problems) | Expected (is the methodology) |

**Embody characteristics**:
- ✓ Months (not years) from start to Stage 5
- ✓ Constrained to JS trace infrastructure
- ✓ Multiple cyclical returns documented
- ✓ Co-created through trading zones
- ✓ Dead ends documented (extrapolated NMs)
- ✓ Systematic rigor with pragmatic scope
- ✓ Infrastructure for future sprints
- ✓ Iteration is visible, valued feature

## Why "Sprint" Terminology

### Borrowed from Agile Development

**Sprint characteristics**:
- **Time-boxed**: Constrained scope and timeline
- **Iterative**: Expect to cycle back
- **Incremental**: Each sprint adds value
- **Collaborative**: Cross-functional teams
- **Shippable**: Stage 5 always produces output

**All apply to TS**:
- Embody sprint had constraints (JS only)
- We cycled back multiple times (theory-to-requirements iterations)
- Each subdirectory added incremental value
- Trading zones = cross-functional (researchers + practitioners)
- We shipped Stage 5 documentation

### More Appropriate Than Alternatives

**Not "milestones"** (too rigid):
- Implies must complete before proceeding
- Doesn't accommodate cyclical returns
- Borrowed from project management (waterfall mentality)

**Not "phases"** (too confusing):
- TCER already uses "phases"
- Would imply strict sequence
- Doesn't convey agile spirit

**"Sprint" captures**:
- Flexibility and adaptation
- Cyclical iteration
- Time-boxed focus
- Agile responsiveness

- Validate sprint pattern in CER

**Refine TS model**:
- What works in infrastructure sprints?
- How to decide when to return to previous stage?
- What counts as Stage 5 "packaged"?

**Generalize pattern**:
- Apply to type systems, collaboration tools, debugging
- Any domain needing measurement infrastructure
- Build methodological knowledge

## Key Takeaways

### 1. Dual Role is Research Contribution

**Embody AS sprint**:
- Demonstrates TS methodology
- Shows TCER operationalization
- Provides replicable pattern

**Embody ENABLING sprints**:
- Accelerates future research
- Coordinates multi-institution work
- Builds infrastructure for TRPs

**Both matter**: Methodological + infrastructural contributions

### 2. TS Operationalizes TCER

**TCER tells you WHAT**:
- 5 phases, bodies of knowledge, continua
- Framework for understanding CER

**TS tells you HOW**:
- 6 stages, cyclical process, agile principles
- Methodology for doing CER

**Together**: Actionable translational research

### 3. Agile Principles Apply to Research

**Not just software development buzzwords**:
- Iteration improves rigor (not reduces it)
- Constraints enable focus (not limit impact)
- Collaboration amplifies expertise (not dilutes it)
- Shipping early enables learning (not premature)

**Embody validates**: Agile research is feasible, valuable, rigorous

### 4. Infrastructure Accelerates Science

**Pattern from other fields**:
- CERN → particle physics experiments
- Hubble → astronomical observations
- GenBank → genomics research

**Pattern in CER**:
- Embody → trace-based learning studies

**Shared infrastructure** → **coordinated research programmes**
