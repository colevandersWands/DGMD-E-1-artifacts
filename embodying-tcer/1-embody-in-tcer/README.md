# Embody in TCER

**Mapping the Embody project to the Translational Computing Education Research framework**

---

## Overview

This section provides a comprehensive analysis of **where and how Embody operates within the TCER model**. The key finding: **Embody doesn't fit in a single phase or activity**—it spans multiple phases simultaneously, operates in trading zones, and exemplifies the translational spectrum.

### Core Thesis

Embody is translational research that:
1. **Creates domain-specific theories** (Phase 1.B)
2. **Synthesizes research for academics** (Phase 3.A)
3. **Synthesizes research for practitioners** (Phase 3.B)
4. **Builds evidence-based prototypes** (Phase 4.A)
5. **Enables future experimental and scaled work** (Phases 2, 4.B, 5.A/B)

This **multi-phase presence is expected and valued** in the TCER model—it's what translational work looks like.

## The Multi-Phase Nature of Embody

### Why Embody Spans Multiple Phases

From our analysis informed by the TCER model:

**1. Tool Creation Requires Theory Creation**
- Can't specify "what to trace" without theories of "what matters educationally"
- Building Embody required developing 12 JavaScript notional machines (Phase 1.B)
- This is theory development, not theory application

**2. Evidence-Based Prototyping Requires Synthesis**
- Can't be "evidence-based" without synthesizing evidence
- Embody's foundation is comprehensive literature review (Phase 3.A)
- This is research synthesis, not just reference gathering

**3. Trading Zones Require Multiple Expertise Types**
- Can't coordinate research and practice from one position
- Embody bridges researchers (3.A), practitioners (3.B), and deployment (4.A)
- This is translational coordination, not single-phase work

**4. Translational Spectrum Means Bidirectional Flow**
- Can't translate if you only move one direction
- Embody will inform theory refinement when deployed (4.B → 1.B)
- This is cyclical, not linear

### Why This is Expected in TCER

From the paper (Cole et al., 2023, p.3):

> "While the TCER model might seem to be linear with siloed progression from theory to intervention, we foresee strong feedback loops between all research activities. This dynamic has also been called the 'translational science spectrum'."

**Embody exemplifies this spectrum**:
- Not "just" a Phase 4.A tool
- Not "just" a Phase 1.B theory contribution
- **Both simultaneously**, with feedback loops between them

- Creates new domain-specific theoretical frameworks
- Extends established NM research (Sorva, Guo, Ben-Ari) to JavaScript concepts
- Contributes to **Theoretical CER** body of knowledge
- From **Fundamental Research** realm

**TCER classification**: This is theory development (1.B), not theory application.

**Contribution**: The Embody execution tracer itself

**Evidence**:
- The codebase (instrumentation, configuration, trace output)
- Evidence-based design (grounded in 30+ papers)
- Prototype status (research tool, not production system yet)

**Why this is Phase 4.A (Trading Zone) work**:
- Designs prototype for targeted educational outcomes
- Evidence-based (every design decision traceable to research)
- Coordinates between research (needs), practice (constraints), and implementation (technical)
- Contributes to **Applied CER** body of knowledge

## How Embody Accelerates Other Phases

While not directly contributing to these phases yet, Embody **enables** future work:

### Phase 2.A/B: Controlled Experiments

**How Embody accelerates**:
- Provides measurement infrastructure for testing educational theories
- Enables experiments that weren't feasible before (trace-based studies)
- Allows controlled manipulation of trace granularity to test effects

**Example future work**:
- "Do students learn closures better with/without scope-capture events visible?"
- "Does trace granularity affect debugging performance?"
- These are Phase 2.B experiments enabled by Phase 4.A infrastructure

### Phase 4.B: User Feedback & Reports

**How Embody will generate this**:
- When deployed, will produce usage data
- Tool developers will provide feedback on configuration needs
- Researchers will report on trace data utility
- This feedback will inform Phase 1.B theory refinement

**Future work**: Currently Phase 4.A prototype stage, hasn't reached Phase 4.B deployment yet

### Phase 5.A/B: Scaled Interventions

**How Embody enables**:
- Provides infrastructure for large-scale educational tools
- Allows deployment of evidence-based interventions at scale
- Enables impact analysis through systematic trace data collection

**Example future work**:
- Large-scale deployment of misconception detection tools using Embody
- Impact analysis of trace-based debugging support across multiple institutions

## The Trading Zone Function

### Embody as Trading Zone 4.A*

**Coordinates between**:
- **CER Researchers**: Need measurement capability, evidence generation
- **Educational Tool Developers**: Need trace data, configuration APIs
- **Programming Educators**: Need student assessment, debugging support
- **Language Semantics Experts**: Need correct JavaScript instrumentation

**Locally coordinated** (what they agree on):
- `embody(script, config) → trace` interface
- Trace data should be accurate and configurable
- Configuration should be granular and semantic

**Not globally coordinated** (what they don't need to agree on):
- Which educational theory to use (researchers differ)
- How to interpret trace data (depends on pedagogy)
- What to build with traces (tool developers' choice)
- When to use traces (educators' judgment)

**Why this works**:
- Embody stays **theory-neutral** (doesn't encode one pedagogy)
- Different stakeholders use same infrastructure for different purposes
- Local coordination without requiring global alignment

**This is exactly what trading zones are for**.

## The Continuum Span

### RT → RD → PT Position

From the [Research/Practice Continuum diagram](../0-tcer-model-foundations/diagrams/research-practice-continuum.ascii):

**RT (Research Theories)** position:
- Phase 1.B: Notional machines as validated theoretical constructs
- Evaluated by methodology (systematic literature-based development)
- Contributes to understanding (how JavaScript execution should be conceptualized)

**RD (Research Designs)** position:
- Phase 3.A: Trace configuration schemas as research instruments
- Evaluated by methodology (systematic theory-to-requirements translation)
- Contributes to practice via research (enables empirical studies)

**PT (Practice Theories)** position:
- Phase 3.B/4.A: Tool developer guidelines as useful heuristics
- Evaluated by usefulness in practice (does it help build tools?)
- Contributes to understanding (what trace data educational tools need)

**Key insight**: Embody maintains all three positions simultaneously, not sequentially.

## Comparison to Traditional Tool Classification

### If We Didn't Use TCER Framework

**Traditional view**: "Embody is an educational tool"
- Implies it's "just" dissemination (Phase 3 or 5)
- Misses the theoretical contributions (Phase 1)
- Misses the synthesis work (Phase 3)
- Undervalues the research nature of tool creation

**Problem**: This framing makes tool creation seem like "application" of research, not research itself

### Using TCER Framework

**TCER view**: "Embody is translational research spanning Phases 1, 3, and 4"
- Recognizes theoretical contributions (1.B)
- Recognizes synthesis contributions (3.A/B)
- Recognizes prototyping as research activity (4.A)
- Values tool creation as knowledge creation

**Benefit**: This framing accurately captures the research contributions and situates tool creation within the broader research ecosystem

---

## Implications for Documentation

### Why This TCER Analysis Matters

**For theory-to-requirements**:
- Can confidently claim research contributions, not just "applying" research
- Can cite specific TCER phases for each type of work
- Can explain why so much work exists (it spans multiple phases)

**For external communication**:
- Clear framing: "Phase 1.B, 3.A/B, 4.A translational research"
- Justification: "This is what translational work looks like"
- Positioning: "Operating in trading zones 3.B* and 4.A*"

**For understanding project scope**:
- Not "scope creep"—it's the nature of translational research
- Different phases serve different stakeholders
- All phases necessary for impact

## Summary

**Embody's TCER position**:
- **Phases**: 1.B (theories), 3.A (research synthesis), 3.B* (practitioner synthesis), 4.A* (prototype)
- **Realms**: Spans Fundamental Research, Synthesis, and Praxis
- **Bodies of Knowledge**: Contributes to Theoretical CER, State of the Art, and Applied CER
- **Continuum**: RT → RD → PT span
- **Trading Zones**: Operates in 3.B* and 4.A*, coordinating diverse stakeholders

**Key insight**: This multi-phase, trading-zone, continuum-spanning nature is **not unusual**—it's what translational research looks like. The TCER model was designed to accommodate exactly this kind of work.
