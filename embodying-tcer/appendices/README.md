## A. Translational Research Programmes via Sprints

### What Are TRPs?

From Cole et al. (2023, Section 4):

> "By coordinating diverse research projects dealing with different aspects of the same problem, TRPs can address challenges in CE that are too complex or diffuse for a single researcher or institution."

**TRP characteristics**:
- Multi-institution coordination
- Multiple research groups tackling related problems
- Shared infrastructure or frameworks
- Address large-scale CE challenges
- Span multiple TCER phases simultaneously

**Translational Sprint coordination**: TRPs can be structured as coordinated sprints where institutions execute independent TS cycles while sharing infrastructure (Stage 0 foundation across institutions).

### Embody as Potential TRP Core

**Current status**: Embody is single-institution Phase 4.A* prototype

**TRP potential**: Embody could serve as **technical infrastructure** for multi-institution research programme

#### Possible TRP Structure via Coordinated Sprints

**Theme**: "Trace-Based Programming Education Research"

**Coordinating question**: "How can execution traces improve programming learning outcomes across different contexts and populations?"

**Sprint structure**:

| Institution | Sprint Focus | TS Stages | TCER Phases |
|-------------|--------------|-----------|-------------|
| **Uni A** | Closure learning scaffolds | Stages 2-3 | Phases 2.A/B, 4.B |
| **Uni B** | Loop pattern pedagogy | Stages 2-4 | Phases 2.A/B, 4.B |
| **Uni C** | Async intro strategies | Stage 4 | Phase 4.B |
| **Uni D** | Meta-analysis synthesis | Stage 5 | Phase 3.A |
| **Shared** | **Embody infrastructure** | **Stage 0 foundation** | **Phase 4.A*** |

**Embody's accelerator role**: Eliminates Stage 2 instrumentation bottleneck for all institutions

- Each executes independent TS cycle (local autonomy)
- All use same measurement infrastructure (comparability)
- Shared Stage 5 outputs build cumulative knowledge
- Trading zone at programme scale enables coordination without consensus

#### Why Embody Fits TRP Role

**Neutral infrastructure**:
- Doesn't encode specific pedagogy
- Serves diverse theoretical perspectives
- Configurable for different research questions

**Evidence-based**:
- Grounded in systematic theory-to-requirements process
- Replicable methodology others can validate
- Clear theoretical foundations (12 notional machines)

**Open design**:
- Theory-to-requirements documented publicly
- Configuration API is transparent
- Can be adapted to other languages (Python, Java versions)

**Enables coordination**:
- Common trace format allows cross-study comparison
- Shared instrumentation reduces duplication
- Trading zone for researchers across institutions

### TRP Coordination Mechanisms

**What coordinated TRP sprints need**:

1. **Stage 0 foundation**: Relationship building and shared infrastructure (Embody provides)
2. **Independent cycles**: Each institution runs Stages 1-5 at own pace
3. **Shared Stage 5 packaging**: Coordinated documentation and config recipe library
4. **Meta-synthesis sprints**: Dedicated institutions running Stage 5 synthesis across all
5. **Feedback loops**: Collective learning refines shared infrastructure

**What Embody enables**:
- Shared Stage 0 foundation eliminating per-institution tool building
- Consistent measurement enabling meta-analysis
- Time savings (6-12 months per sprint) accelerating all participants

### Out of Scope for Current Work

**Why TRP is appendix, not main section**:
- Embody is **currently** single-institution Phase 4.A* work
- TRP requires multi-institution coordination (future potential)
- Current contribution is infrastructure + methodology, not TRP coordination

**But worth documenting** because:
- Shows how Phase 4.A* infrastructure enables TRPs
- Positions Embody for future collaborative work
- Demonstrates trading zone concept at programme scale

### TRP Examples in Other Fields

**To show pattern**:

| Field | TRP Theme | Shared Infrastructure | Outcomes |
|-------|-----------|----------------------|----------|
| **Physics** | Particle physics | CERN LHC | Higgs boson discovery (2012) |
| **Genomics** | Human genome | Sequencing tech + databases | Human Genome Project (2003) |
| **Climate** | Climate modeling | Shared simulation frameworks | IPCC reports |
| **CER (potential)** | **Trace-based learning** | **Embody infrastructure** | **Multi-institution findings** |

**Pattern**: Neutral infrastructure enables coordinated research without requiring theoretical alignment.

## B. Quick Reference

### TCER Glossary

**Bidirectional Translation**
: Knowledge flows both theory → practice and practice → theory. Not a pipeline, but a spectrum.

**Bodies of Knowledge**
: Five categories: Theoretical CER, Experimental CER, State of the Art, Applied CER, Educational Impact. Accumulated through translational phases.

**Continuum**
: Two axes (Research ↔ Practice, Theory ↔ Design) creating four quadrants (RT, RD, PT, PD). Contributions can span multiple positions.

**Phase 1.A\***
: General or Borrowed Theories. Trading zone bringing theories from other disciplines into CER.

**Phase 1.B**
: Domain-Specific Theories. Creating theories specific to computing education (e.g., notional machines for JavaScript).

**Phase 2.A**
: Theory-based Designs. Experimental designs to test or develop theories in controlled settings.

**Phase 2.B**
: Controlled Experiments. Empirical validation of theories through rigorous experiments.

**Phase 3.A**
: Researcher-facing Literature Reviews. Systematic synthesis for academic audiences.

**Phase 3.B\***
: Practitioner-facing Guidelines. Evidence-based guidance for educators, tool developers. Trading zone.

**Phase 4.A\***
: Evidence-based Prototypes. Research-grade tools/interventions. Trading zone coordinating research and practice.

**Phase 4.B\***
: User Feedback & Reports. Insights from deployment that inform theory refinement. Trading zone.

**Phase 5.A\***
: Scalable Contextualised Interventions. Large-scale deployment with adaptation. Trading zone.

**Phase 5.B\***
: Educational Impact Analysis. Analyzing outcomes from scaled interventions, feeding back to theory. Trading zone.

**Praxis Realm**
: One of three realms. Focused on designing evidence-based solutions for CE practice (Phases 4-5).

**Reflexive Analysis**
: Layer 7 (foundation) of TCER. Self-reflection and re-definition culture enabling field to stay relevant.

**Research Theories (RT)**
: Continuum quadrant. Methodologically validated theories, evaluated by research methodology, contribute to understanding.

**Research Designs (RD)**
: Continuum quadrant. Designs created for literature/theory testing, evaluated by methodology, contribute to practice via research.

**Practice Theories (PT)**
: Continuum quadrant. Useful heuristics for practitioners, evaluated by usefulness, contribute to understanding.

**Practice Designs (PD)**
: Continuum quadrant. Designs for impact, evaluated by effectiveness, contribute to practice.

**Synthesis Realm**
: One of three realms. Focused on consolidating and communicating knowledge (Phase 3).

**Fundamental Research Realm**
: One of three realms. Focused on developing and validating theories (Phases 1-2).

**Three Realms**
: Fundamental Research, Synthesis, Praxis. Equal in value, no hierarchy. Layer 2 of TCER model.

**Trading Zone**
: Arena where radically different activities coordinate locally but not globally (Galison, 1996). Marked with * in TCER (6 of 10 activities). Enables transdisciplinary collaboration without forced consensus.

**Translational Phases**
: Layer 4 of TCER. Five phases (1-5) structuring theory/design and research/practice continuum into actionable activities.

**Translational Research**
: Research where knowledge flows bidirectionally between theory and practice. Not one-way application.

**Transdiscipline**
: Involving researchers and non-researchers, transcending disciplinary boundaries through role release and role expansion (Choi & Pak, 2006).

**TRP (Translational Research Programme)**
: Coordinated multi-institution effort addressing complex CE challenges through systematic integration of research activities.

### Key Quotes from Paper

**On bidirectional translation** (p.3):
> "While the TCER model might seem to be linear with siloed progression from theory to intervention, we foresee strong feedback loops between all research activities. This dynamic has also been called the 'translational science spectrum'."

**On trading zones** (p.5, quoting Galison 1996):
> "Trading zones [are] 'an arena in which radically different activities could be locally, but not globally, coordinated.'"

**On reflexive analysis** (p.5):
> "A field without the culture and mechanisms to support self-reflection and re-definition cannot stay relevant."

**On equal value of contributions** (p.4):
> "No contribution is more important than another and it is a question of context, with different contributions being more valuable to different activities."

**On Phase 4 importance** (p.5):
> "Phase 4 activities are vital as they are directly beneficial to both CE practitioners and CER researchers, thus motivating active collaboration."

**On transdisciplinary nature** (p.2, quoting Choi & Pak 2006):
> "Transdisciplinary involves scientists from different disciplines as well as non-scientists and other stakeholders and, through role release and role expansion, transcends (hence 'trans') the disciplinary boundaries to look at the dynamics of whole systems in a holistic way."
