# DGMD E-1 Artifacts

A collection of artifacts I created along the way.

- **[`embody`](https://github.com/colevandersWands/embody)**: The library for generating traces of learners' JS programs.
- **[Theory to Requirements](./theory-to-requirements/README.md)**: An experiment using Claude to help with a snowballing literture review to help determine which data to gather about program execution, and which config options to provide. An experiment in AI collaboration.
- **[`Embody`ing TCER](./embodying-tcer/README.md)**: Exploring the relationship between tool development and pedagogical innovations under the Translational Computing Education Research model. Also an experiment in AI collaboration.
- **[`Embody` Use-Cases](./embody-use-cases/README.md)**: Brainstorming use-cases for `embody`, landed on [StoryLines](./embody-use-cases/ai-integrated/storylines/REAMDE.md) for the project writeup
