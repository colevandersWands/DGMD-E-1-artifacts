One of our first discoveries was that programming knowledge consists of at least four distinct kinds of knowledge:

1. Reading programming language notations (e.g., understanding syntax and how it corresponds to semantics). This was related to program tracing skills.
2. Writing semantics in programming language notation. We found that this was significantly different from reading semantics, in that it was really a translation task, identifying patterns of computation in the mind, and finding constructs that would express them.
3. Reading templated patterns of computation in a programming language notation (e.g., recognizing that a series of statements was a swap, or that a loop was searching). This most closely corresponds to literature on program comprehension.
4. Writing patterns of computation in a programming language notation. This mostly closely corresponds to algorithm design.
