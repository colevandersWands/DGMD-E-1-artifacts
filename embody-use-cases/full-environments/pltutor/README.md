> [Greg's dissertation](https://digital.lib.washington.edu/server/api/core/bitstreams/2e6d58fb-53c0-4370-8c06-75fdd2216a39/content). A few years back I called with Greg and explored his live prototype. I can't find a live link anymore, so everything in here is based on his paper(s), my notes and my memory.

overall thing is good, with a couple limitations:

- not full support for modern JS
- authoring is inaccessible
- no support for modifying the examples
