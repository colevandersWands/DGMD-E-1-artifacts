# StoryLines

Enable learners to generate stories (not just explanations!) of how their programs work. To ensure the stories are accurate, the story generation will have access to a toolchain which includes pipeline utilities for:

- dynamic trace data generated by `embody`
- pedagogical static analysis provided by `examine` (a hypothetical tool)
- linting data provided by industry standard tools such as `eslint`
- variable role analysis (see [/stand-alone-objectives/variable-roles](../../stand-alone-objectives/variable-roles/), it would rely partly on `embody` traces)
- analysis & evaluation of variable names by mapping program structure, variable roles and program domain (does not exist, but can be built)

Configuration options allow learners to tailor the story generated to their learning focus and prefered metaphors.
