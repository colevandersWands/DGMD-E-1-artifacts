THE GREMLIN & THE SPELL OF TRANSFERENCE

A gremlin approaches a blank chalkboard, clutching an ancient scroll that glows faintly.

"The Ritual of Value Exchange," it whispers, unrolling the parchment with reverence.

"`let a = 2;`" — The first incantation! The gremlin draws a box labeled [a] and inscribes "2" within.
"`let b = 1;`" — Another verse. A second box [b] appears, blessed with "1".
"`let temp;`" — The third chant. Box [temp] materializes, empty and waiting.

"Now for the transference spell," the gremlin mutters, chalk trembling.

"`temp = a;`" — It peers into [a], sees the sacred 2, duplicates it into [temp].
"`a = b;`" — Gazing at [b]'s 1, it erases [a]'s old mark, inscribing the new.
"`b = temp;`" — Finally, [temp]'s 2 flows into [b], completing the exchange.

The gremlin steps back, exhausted. The ritual is complete: [a] holds 1, [b] holds 2.

"The ancient magic works!" it gasps. The values have danced their mystical swap.
