# JavaScript Threshold Concepts

**Phase 1.A***: Borrowed theories (trading zone)

**Direct guidance for educational tool developers detecting conceptual barriers in JavaScript learning**

---

## Quick Start

1. **[threshold-concepts-overview.md](./threshold-concepts-overview.md)** - What are threshold concepts and which 4 matter for JavaScript
2. **[trace-patterns-for-detection.md](./trace-patterns-for-detection.md)** - Code examples showing how to analyze trace data for threshold indicators  
3. **[educational-integration.md](./educational-integration.md)** - How threshold detection enhances SOLO/Block Model/BSI frameworks
4. **[research-validation.md](./research-validation.md)** - Research status and boundaries (what embody provides vs what you implement)

## Key Insight

**Boundary**: `embody(script, config)` provides raw trace data. Educational tools implement all pattern analysis, detection logic, and interventions.

**Value**: Threshold concept detection helps identify when students hit transformative learning barriers vs surface-level errors.
